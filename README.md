* Facial Recognition using Eigenfaces

This is the repository for my 2020's Linear Algebra class' final project.
Me and my partner chose to implement the Eigenfaces method for face
recognition.

** Contents:
- att-database: Our chosen dataset of faces.
It belongs to AT&T Laboratories Cambridge.
Proper references can be found in the report and the presentation.

- report.pdf: Explains the problem of facial recognition, our
  methodology, results and conclusions.

- presentation.pdf: Presentation version of the report.

- `eigenfaces_mean.py` and `eigenfaces_min.py`: Code files for both
  recognition algorithms we implemented.
